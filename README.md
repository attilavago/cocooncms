# Cocoon-CMS
A simple databaseless CMS built on JavaScript and Google Drive

## Why?

* because I can!
* because some people don't have the technical ability to work with PHP and SQL
* because spreadsheets are a lot easier to understand than many CMSs out there, thus the learning curve for the user is next to none
* because for developers it takes a lot less time to develop than using the traditional methods: less time spent on development => product becomes cheaper = client happier
* because using traditional databases is often an overkill
* because you can host the site on any web-reachable platform, ex: Dropbox, so nobody needs to pay for hosting
* because having a back-up of all your data is as simple as copy-pasting or downloading your spreadsheet
* because it comes with Google's security, so unless you delete your own data or give access to someone else to do it, it's safe
